            <ul>
                <li>Wished that Mr. Darcy had danced with Elizabeth.</li>
                <li>Feels like Darcy's pride can be excused since he has "family, fortune, and everything in his favor" and should therefore think highly of himself. Which basically makes her think he had a right to be proud.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Thinks that a woman concealing her feelings is a disadvantage since she'd lose the chance of securing a relationship.</li>
                <li>Thinks that Jane should make the most of the time she spends with Mr. Bingley.</li>
