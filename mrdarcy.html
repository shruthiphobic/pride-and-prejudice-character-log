            <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>“drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mein.”</li>
                <li>Made 10k a year.</li>
                <li>“much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity.”</li>
                <li>“discovered to the proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased.”</li>
                <li>“forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.”</li>
                <li>Was mostly standoffish during the night and only danced with the women he came with.</li>
                <li>“proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.”</li>
                <li>Hates dancing unless he knows his partner well.</li>
                <li>Calls Elizabeth "tolerable."</li>
                <li>“disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him,” as described by Mrs. Bennet.</li>

            <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>He likes Bingley because he had the "firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion."</li>
                <li>"In understanding, Darcy was the superior."</li>
                <li>He's clever.</li>
                <li>Darcy was arrogant, reserved, and nitpicky. His manners weren't really inviting either.</li>
                <li>He seemed to offend people wherever he went.</li>
                <li>He saw "little beauty and no fashion" in the people at the Meryton assembly and wasn't interested in talking to anyone.</li>
                <li>Nobody gave him attention or pleasure.</li>
                <li>He thought Jane was pretty but she smiled too much (nitpicky).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Probably only speaks when spoken to (the case with Mrs. Long). He still gets mad when people talk to him though.</li>
                <li>Doesn't talk much unless it's among his friends when he actually enjoys talking to them.</li>
            </ul>

        <div id="chapter6">
            <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Only had negative thoughts towards Elizabeth at first but then was drawn to her by her eyes.</li>
                <li>Wanted to get to know Elizabeth more and tried to listen to her conversations with other people.</li>
                <li>"He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him," as said by Charlotte.</li>
                <li>He doesn't dance that much.</li>
                <li>Didn't object to having Elizabeth dance with him.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
            "divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone."
