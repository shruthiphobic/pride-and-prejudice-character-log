                <li>Made 10k a year.</li>
                <li>“much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity.”</li>
                <li>“discovered to the proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased.”</li>
                <li>“forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.”</li>
                <li>Was mostly standoffish during the night and only danced with the women he came with.</li>
                <li>“proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.”</li>

                <li>Calls Elizabeth "tolerable."</li>
                <li>“disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him,” as described by Mrs. Bennet.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>He likes Bingley because he had the "firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion."</li>
                <li>"In understanding, Darcy was the superior."</li>
                <li>He's clever.</li>
                <li>Darcy was arrogant, reserved, and nitpicky. His manners weren't really inviting either.</li>

                <li>He saw "little beauty and no fashion" in the people at the Meryton assembly and wasn't interested in talking to anyone.</li>
                <li>Nobody gave him attention or pleasure.</li>
                <li>He thought Jane was pretty but she smiled too much (nitpicky).</li>
