            <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Said by her father to have “something more of quickness than her sisters.”</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="chapter3">
            <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Mostly unaffected by what Mr. Darcy said about her since she just joked about it.</li>
                <li>“lively, playful disposition, which delighted in everything ridiculous.”</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="chapter4">
            <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Thinks Mr. Bingley has a complete character.</li>
                <li>Isn't convinced by how Jane describes the Bingley sisters since she doesn't really like them.</li>
                <li>Has more "quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister."</li>
                <li>"with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them."</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="chapter5">
            <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Promises her mother that she'd never dance with Mr. Darcy.</li>
                <li>"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine."</li>
                <li>Continues to hold the "tolerable" comment against him.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="chapter6">
            <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Couldn't like the Bingley sisters since they were conceited towards everyone, even her sister.</li>
                <li>Feels like its obvious that Jane likes Mr. Bingley back and that he'd be dumb to not find that out.</li>
                <li>Turns down Mr. Darcy when he asks to dance with her.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="chapter7">
            <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Was worried about her sister being sick so she showed up at Netherfield by walking there despite what her mother said or what the Bingleys would think of her.</li>
                <li>Was extremely concerned about Jane and spent most of her time with her by her bedside.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="chapter8">
            <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Went back to disliking the Bingley sisters after they seemed to be indifferent towards Jane when she wasn't in front of them.</li>
                <li>"Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no beauty," the Bingley sisters' thoughts on Elizabeth.</li>
                <li>Would not leave Jane's side at all.</li>
                <li>"I deserve neither praise nor such censure... I am not a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things."</li>
                <li>Challenges Mr. Darcy and Miss Bingley's definition of accomplished women and claims that no woman fits that description since she felt that they were too demanding.</li>
                <li>"Elizabeth Bennet... is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex, by undervaluing their own," as said by Miss Bingley.</li>
